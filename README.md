Overview

The flow is structured to monitor the state of charge (SOC) of a battery, adjust power set points for charging and discharging, and handle manual operations via injection nodes. It includes functionalities for sending notifications using Pushover.
Nodes Breakdown

Battery SOC Input (victron-input-battery)
    Purpose: Monitors the state of charge of the battery.
    Wires to: a826ca07a7e68bc1 (SOC Change Node).

Grid Setpoint Input (victron-input-ess)
    Purpose: Monitors the setpoint for AC power.
    Wires to: 4aa09e3fb48cf9a3 (Setpoint Change Node).

Change Nodes (change)
    Two nodes (a826ca07a7e68bc1 and 4aa09e3fb48cf9a3) set flow context variables:
        soc: Set to the value of payload from the battery input.
        setpoint: Set to the value of payload from the grid setpoint input.

Inject Nodes
    Used for triggering events at specific times or manually:
        Power Up Session Complete: Sets the system to a resting state.
        Power UP Discharging: Injects a discharge value.
        Power UP Charging: Injects a charge value.
        Power Up Start Session: Activates manual control.
        Power UP Manual Stop: Stops the manual operation.

Function Nodes
    Power UP Discharge: Logic for managing the discharging process based on SOC and time. It adjusts the setpoint based on SOC thresholds.
    Power UP Charge: Similar logic for charging, adjusting based on time and SOC.
    Set Manual Start: Activates manual control by setting flags.
    SOC Monitoring: Monitors SOC and sends notifications if certain conditions are met.
    Power UP Session Complete: Resets the system state after a session.
    Rest For Next Power UP Session: Prepares the system for the next session when manual stop is invoked.

Output Nodes
    Pushover Nodes: Send notifications for various states like starting a discharging session or manual activation.
    Victron Output ESS: Writes the current setpoint back to the Victron system.

Delay Nodes
    Used to throttle the rate of message sending or to introduce pauses.

Logic Flow

Monitoring SOC & Setpoint:
    The flow continuously monitors the battery's state of charge and the current grid setpoint.
    When SOC changes or a new setpoint is injected, it updates the respective flow context variables.

Injecting Commands:
    Specific commands for discharging, charging, and stopping can be injected at predefined times or triggered manually.

Conditional Logic in Functions:
    The function nodes utilize conditions based on time and SOC:
        For example, if SOC exceeds a threshold, the system will change the setpoint accordingly.
        This is to prevent over-discharge or under-charge scenarios.

Notifications:
    Notifications are sent out at critical stages, like starting or stopping a session, keeping the user informed of system states.

Session Management:
    The flow has provisions for manual operation, allowing the user to start or stop operations and reset the system states as needed.

Conclusion

This Node-RED flow is a comprehensive management system for a battery charging and discharging process, utilizing Victron devices. It combines real-time monitoring, conditional logic, and user-triggered actions to optimize battery usage while providing notifications for transpare
